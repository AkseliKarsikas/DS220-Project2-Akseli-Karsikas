# DS 220 – Project #2:
### Author: Akseli Karsikas  

This repository contains my work for **Project #2
For this project, I went over 120 years of Olympic athlete data. The goal was to explore trends in athlete demographics, performance, and participation across different sports and eras.

The notebook documents the entire process of Project 2.
- Importing and cleaning a large dataset  
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualizing distributions and trends  
- Answering 6 research questions about athlete characteristics and Olympic history  

As a gymnast myself, I was interested in exploring how athlete age, height, weight, medal outcomes, and gender representation vary by sport and decade.

I load the dataset directly from Zenodo in the notebook, so the CSV is not stored in this repository due to its size.
